"""Homogeneous Transformation Matrices and Quaternions.

A library for calculating 4x4 matrices for translating, rotating, reflecting,
scaling, shearing, projecting, orthogonalizing, and superimposing arrays of
3D homogeneous coordinates as well as for converting between rotation matrices,
Euler angles, and quaternions. Also includes an Arcball control object and
functions to decompose transformation matrices.

:Version: 2015.07.18

Requirements
------------
* `CPython 2.7 or 3.4 <http://www.python.org>`_
* `Numpy 1.9 <http://www.numpy.org>`_
* `Transformations.c 2015.07.18 <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/>`_
  (recommended for speedup of some functions)

Notes
-----
The API is not stable yet and is expected to change between revisions.

This Python code is not optimized for speed. Refer to the transformations.c
module for a faster implementation of some functions.

Documentation in HTML format can be generated with epydoc.

Matrices (M) can be inverted using numpy.linalg.inv(M), be concatenated using
numpy.dot(M0, M1), or transform homogeneous coordinate arrays (v) using
numpy.dot(M, v) for shape (4, \*) column vectors, respectively
numpy.dot(v, M.T) for shape (\*, 4) row vectors ("array of points").

This module follows the "column vectors on the right" and "row major storage"
(C contiguous) conventions. The translation components are in the right column
of the transformation matrix, i.e. M[:3, 3].
The transpose of the transformation matrices may have to be used to interface
with other graphics systems, e.g. with OpenGL's glMultMatrixd(). See also [16].

Calculations are carried out with numpy.float64 precision.

Vector, point, quaternion, and matrix function arguments are expected to be
"array like", i.e. tuple, list, or numpy arrays.

Return types are numpy arrays unless specified otherwise.

Angles are in radians unless specified otherwise.

Quaternions w+ix+jy+kz are represented as [w, x, y, z].

A triple of Euler angles can be applied/interpreted in 24 ways, which can
be specified using a 4 character string or encoded 4-tuple:

  *Axes 4-string*: e.g. 'sxyz' or 'ryxy'

  - first character : rotations are applied to 's'tatic or 'r'otating frame
  - remaining characters : successive rotation axis 'x', 'y', or 'z'

  *Axes 4-tuple*: e.g. (0, 0, 0, 0) or (1, 1, 1, 1)

  - inner axis: code of axis ('x':0, 'y':1, 'z':2) of rightmost matrix.
  - parity : even (0) if inner axis 'x' is followed by 'y', 'y' is followed
    by 'z', or 'z' is followed by 'x'. Otherwise odd (1).
  - repetition : first and last axis are same (1) or different (0).
  - frame : rotations are applied to static (0) or rotating (1) frame.

Other Python packages and modules for 3D transformations and quaternions:

* `Transforms3d <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transforms3d>`_
   includes most code of this module.
* `Blender.mathutils <http://www.blender.org/api/blender_python_api>`_
* `numpy-dtypes <https://github.com/numpy/numpy-dtypes>`_
