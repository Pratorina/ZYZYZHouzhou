"""Homogeneous Transformation Matrices and Quaternions.

A library for calculating 4x4 matrices for translating, rotating, reflecting,
scaling, shearing, projecting, orthogonalizing, and superimposing arrays of
3D homogeneous coordinates as well as for converting between rotation matrices,
Euler angles, and quaternions. Also includes an Arcball control object and
functions to decompose transformation matrices.

Requirements
------------
* `CPython 2.7 or 3.4 <http://www.python.org>`_
* `Numpy 1.9 <http://www.numpy.org>`_
* `Transformations.c 2015.07.18 <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/>`_
  (recommended for speedup of some functions)

Notes
-----
The API is not stable yet and is expected to change between revisions.

This Python code is not optimized for speed. Refer to the transformations.c
module for a faster implementation of some functions.

Documentation in HTML format can be generated with epydoc.

Matrices (M) can be inverted using numpy.linalg.inv(M), be concatenated using
numpy.dot(M0, M1), or transform homogeneous coordinate arrays (v) using
numpy.dot(M, v) for shape (4, \*) column vectors, respectively
numpy.dot(v, M.T) for shape (\*, 4) row vectors ("array of points").

This module follows the "column vectors on the right" and "row major storage"
(C contiguous) conventions. The translation components are in the right column
of the transformation matrix, i.e. M[:3, 3].
The transpose of the transformation matrices may have to be used to interface
